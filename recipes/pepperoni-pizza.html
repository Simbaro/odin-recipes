    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      This pizza recipe is the best you can ask for!! Tons of pepperoni, a nice
      crust, great flavor, and maybe even a surprise or two to put it over the
      top.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
      <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
      <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500°F: If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in
        the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the
        ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You
        can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the dough: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's
        hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room
        temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a
        14-inch diameter circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the toppings: Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel.
        Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron. Add sauce in a light layer
        all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop
        half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with
        grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the pizza: If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza
        into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then
        rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6 to 8
        minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots. If
        you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add
        toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get
        it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a
        500 °F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice and serve: Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board.
        Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh
        oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
